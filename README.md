# todo-webapp

nothing much to say. this project was one of my smaller trainer projects.
it runs a todo list locally (so localhost).

you can add a todo, check a todo, remove a todo.

to install it you can clone the repo and run pipeline.sh
the pipeline will set up docker so be sure to have docker set up.

might add a better install method in the future if i see it fit.
